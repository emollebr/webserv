has to be done: 

!!!
ROOT DIRECTIVE: NGINX: Location block will have the root prepended to the URL, NOT replacing the location match
!!!
Error pages no working
CGI get path not working
MAKE hostname / server name

proper status and error code check:
    sending 404 page when needed
    differentiating 0 and -1 from recv()
