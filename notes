has to be done: 

connecting to ip besides 127.0.0.1 ?
MAKE hostname / server name

!!!
ROOT DIRECTIVE: NGINX: Location block will have the root prepended to the URL, NOT replacing the location match
!!!
Error pages no working
CGI get path not working

proper status and error code check:
    sending 404 page when needed
    differentiating 0 and -1 from recv()
