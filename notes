has to be done: 

!!!
ROOT DIRECTIVE: NGINX: Location block will have the root prepended to the URL, NOT replacing the location match
!!!

MAKE tests for server run, is it non blocking at all times, what if multiple big uploads or downloads at the same time
MAKE hostname / server name

proper status and error code check:
    sending 404 page when needed
    differentiating 0 and -1 from recv()
