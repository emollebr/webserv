has to be done: 

nested locations?
How to know if there are nested locations
MAKE tests for locations, are they all being checked, are nested locations working
MAKE tests for server run, is it non blocking, what if multiple big uploads or downloads at the same time
TEST if directory listing works when autoindex = 1 and index is not configured
MAKE hostname / server name
MAKE max body size per location
TEST redirections

CONFIG
There should be a default root for the server
Autoindex is not properly detected (off when configured on)


    if location and index = index
    if location, no index and autoindex = list
    else error

    Try to list a directory. ?

    Try a redirected URL. ? http redirection


proper status and error code check:
    sending 404 page when needed
    differentiating 0 and -1 from recv()
